# HW5: Wordle & Scheduling (Backtracking & Recursion)

## Overview
This project is part of the course **Data Structures & Object-Oriented Design** and focuses on **recursive backtracking and constraint satisfaction problems**.  
It includes two independent problem domains: a Wordle-style word matching system and a nurse scheduling system that assigns workers to shifts while respecting multiple constraints.

The assignment emphasizes **search-based problem solving, recursion, pruning invalid states, and careful state management**, highlighting how backtracking can be applied to real-world constraints.

## Features
- Recursive backtracking solutions
- Constraint checking and early pruning of invalid paths
- Wordle-style word matching and filtering logic
- Nurse scheduling with availability and workload constraints
- Construction of valid solutions when they exist
- Modular design separating logic and testing
- Build automation using a Makefile

## Notes
Completed during Fall 2025.
